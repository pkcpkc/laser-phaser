## 🚀 The Vision

**Laser Phaser** is born from the wild imaginations of **Leopold** and **Thaddeus**—two young Star Wars fans who spent their days drawing epic spaceships and dreaming of galactic battles. 

What started as sketches on paper has been brought to life through the incredible power of **Agentic Coding**. Using [**Google Antigravity**](https://antigravity.google/) and [**Phaser.io**](https://phaser.io/), we've turned those childhood dreams into a high-octane reality. (With a little help from **Paul** to keep the engines running! 😉)

## 🕹️ A Love Letter to the 80s

If you grew up with the pulse-pounding action of 80s arcade shooters, you'll feel right at home. **Laser Phaser** is a deep homage to the legends that defined a generation:

*   **R-Type** - For its iconic level design and massive bosses.
*   **Xenon II Megablast** - For that gritty, metallic vibe and "Bomb the Bass" energy.
*   **Blood Money** - For the relentless challenge and atmosphere.
*   **Katakis** - For the pure joy of side-scrolling mastery.
