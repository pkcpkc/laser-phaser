### belt
I jolt awake to the screaming of alarms. I'm drifting helpless in the gravity well of THE BELT.

I need to blast a path or dodge these rocks to survive.

Strange alien signals are piercing the static... and they don't sound friendly. But right now, the asteroids are the only thing that matters!

### vortex
Warning! Incoming transmission... rejected. The Blood Hunters don't negotiate.

These evil scavengers are only interested in one thing: looting my ship.

I see Fighters and Bombers on the scope. They are swarming the vortex. I must destroy them before they pick my bones clean!

I'm intercepting strange reports in their comms... something about a warp gate on planet Halo. If it's true, that's my way out of this forsaken galaxy!

### halo
I've reached the planet Halo, but a massive signature is blocking the warp gate.

It's the Blood Boss. It stands between me and the transition to the next galaxy.

I hope the next sector is more peaceful, but to get there, I have to go through him!
